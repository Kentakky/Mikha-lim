<h2 style="text-align:center;color:black;background-color:yellow";>concept of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been around for several decades. While it's difficult to pinpoint an exact starting point, I can give you an overview of its evolution</h2>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:black;background-color:yellow";>The term "information technology" emerged in the 1970s, but its roots date back to World War II, when the military and industry collaborated on developing electronics, computers, and information theory.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:black;background-color:yellow";>In the 1950s, the first commercial computers were developed, with the UNIVAC I being the first one, released in 1951. This marked the beginning of the computer era, which would eventually lead to the development of ICT as we know it today.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:black;background-color:yellow";>The 1980s saw the introduction of personal computers, with IBM releasing its first PC in 1981. This democratized access to computers and paved the way for the widespread adoption of ICT in various sectors, including education, healthcare, and business.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:black;background-color:yellow";>In the 1990s and 2000s, the internet and mobile technologies became increasingly prevalent, further expanding the reach and impact of ICT.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align:center;color:black;background-color:yellow";>Today, ICT is an integral part of our daily lives, transforming the way we communicate, work, and access information.</h2>
